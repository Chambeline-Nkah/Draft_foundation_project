# DigiGirls Technnovation

## Overview

DigiGirls Technnovation is an educational platform aimed at empowering young girls in the technology industry. Our goal is to bridge the gender gap and provide a supportive environment for girls to pursue successful careers in technology.

## Problem Statement

The tech industry is currently heavily male-dominated, with only 25% of the workforce comprising women. This gender imbalance hinders diversity and limits opportunities for girls and women. We want to change this narrative and inspire more girls to pursue tech education and careers.

## Proposed Solution

Our platform offers immersive learning pathways, self-paced courses, and personalized mentorship to help participants master programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We provide hands-on projects and hackathon competitions to gain practical experience.
